Code for FINE3300's Asssignment 1: Calculating Mortgage Payments and Exchange Rate Calculator (USD/CAD)
For the Exchange Rate Calculator, make sure you have the BankOfCanadaExchangeRates.csv file in the same parent folder as the code file.
Other than that, enjoy the programs! I put in extra work to beautify the front end UI a little bit.
